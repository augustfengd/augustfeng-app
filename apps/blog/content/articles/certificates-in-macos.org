#+title: Certificates in MacOS

* About

I noticed a few different descriptions for certificates when viewing them in
Safari.

As a result, I wanted to be able to produce them myself to learn.

* Experiments
** Root certificate authority

This certificate has the description of *Root certificate authority* when
presented to Safari.

#+begin_src shell
  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
#+end_src

** Self-signed root certificate

This certificate has the description of *Self-signed root certificate* when
presented to Safari.

I think the magic sauce is the presence of *Subject Alternative Name*.

#+begin_src toml
[ req ]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions    = v3_req
prompt             = no

[ req_distinguished_name ]
CN = ca.local

[ v3_req ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = ca.local
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell
  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server-key.pem -out server-cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -config san.cnf
#+end_src

** Issued by a local certificate authority

This certificate has the description of *Issued by: ca.local* when presented to
Safari.

#+begin_src shell
  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ca-key.pem -out ca-cert.pem -days 365 -nodes

  openssl genrsa -out server-key.pem 2048
  openssl req -new -key server-key.pem -out server-csr.pem

  openssl x509 -req -in server-csr.pem -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out server-cert.pem -days 825 -sha256
#+end_src
