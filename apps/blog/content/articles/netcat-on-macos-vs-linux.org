#+title: netcat on MacOS vs Linux

* MacOS

When we run a TCP server (~nc -l 1234~) with nc and send it traffic with a
client (~echo foobar | nc localhost 1234~) nc , the client will exist.

* Linux

When we run a TCP server (~nc -l 1234~) with nc and send it traffic with a
client (~echo foobar | nc localhost 1234~) nc , the client will *not* exit.

We need to include the ~-N~ flag when running nc.

* Caveats

For the record, I've only experimented with MacOS's netcat implementation, and
the netcat-openbsd implementation on Linux.
