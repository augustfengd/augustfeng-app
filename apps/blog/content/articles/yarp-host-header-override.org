* About

I was curious to see how the yarp proxy handles the host header when proxying.

* Learning

They copy over all the original request headers to a new http message.
Afterwards, a set of transformers are applied to the http message.

One of these transformers is the ~RequestHeaderOriginalHostTransform~ which
overrides the *Host* header with the destination host.

#+begin_src csharp
  else if (existingHost is null || string.Equals(originalHost, existingHost, StringComparison.Ordinal))
  {
      // Use the host from destination configuration (which may be null) if either:
      // * there is no host header set, or
      // * the original host header is being suppressed and has not been modified by the transform pipeline
      context.ProxyRequest.Headers.Host = destinationConfigHost;
  }
#+end_src
