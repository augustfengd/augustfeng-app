* Creating snippets

The command ~yas-new-snippet~ will open a form for creating snippets.

The ~# name:~ and ~# key:~ fields describe the name of the snippet, and the
abbreviation of the snippets before expansion.

* Authoring snippets

** embedded lisp code in template

Wrap the lisp code with ~`~. This will be evaluated upon expansion.

** avoiding auto indentations

The leading space before $2 is deleted when the template is inserted. We need to
use the directive ~# expand-env: ((yas-indent-line 'fixed))~ to avoid that.

#+begin_quote
* $1
:PROPERTIES:
:ANKI_DECK: $2
:END:
$0
#+end_quote

* Viewing snippets
** individual snippets

We can visit individual snippets with the ~M-x yas/visit-snippet-file~ command.

** snippet directories

The top-level snippet directories is configured with the ~yas-snippet-dirs~
variable.

The directory is organized by major modes and their applicable snippets.
