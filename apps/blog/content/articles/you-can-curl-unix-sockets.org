#+title: You can cURL unix sockets

* About

The docker API is hosted by default on a unix socket. It's mostly HTTP REST
APIs, so let's cURL it.


* cURL only

The cURL cli supports unix sockets.

#+begin_src shell
  curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http:/localhost/images/json | jq
#+end_src

* cURL with pipes
** nc

We can chain a series of ~nc~ processes but the traffic is unable to flow back
to the caller.

#+begin_src shell
  nc -l 1234 | nc -U /var/run/docker.sock
#+end_src

When we ~curl http://localhost:1234/images/json~, the response will be sent to
the stdout connected to the second ~nc~ process instead of making its way back
to the curl process.

** socat

We can avoid a pipeline by using ~socat~:

#+begin_src
  socat TCP-LISTEN:1234 UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/docker.sock
#+end_src

And now we can ~curl http://localhost:1234/images/json~.
