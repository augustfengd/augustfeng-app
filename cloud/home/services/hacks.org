* About

Here lies some manual hacks I did to get things going. A proper solution will be
implemented when the motivation is right. That's a commitment for future me.

* Hacks

** remove node taint from master

I'm running a single node setup, so I'll need the control plane as workers.

#+begin_src shell
   k taint nodes laptop2020 node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule-
#+end_src

** disable systemd-resolved.service

Ubuntu machines does something that involves hosting a local dns server. Since
I'm hosting a dns service (pihole), I'll disable this.

#+begin_src shell
  systemctl stop systemd-resolved.service
  systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service
#+end_src
