* Finding source code for classes and packages

The *Kpathsea* library, short for Karl's Path Searching, provides an API for the
TeX engine to find files. It comes with a CLI *kpsewhich* which we can use to
find files:

#+begin_src shell :results verbatim
  kpsewhich article.cls # class
  kpsewhich geometry.sty # package
  # /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls
  # /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/geometry/geometry.sty
#+end_src

I read this from the a post from Overleaf: [[https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/An_introduction_to_Kpathsea_and_how_TeX_engines_search_for_files][An introduction to Kpathsea and how
TeX engines search for files]].

* Enumerating classes and packages

There is a file, ~$(kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFDIST)/ls-R~ that enumerates all
files and their location.

#+begin_src shell :results verbatim
  grep --after 1 './tex/latex/geometry:' $(kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFDIST)/ls-R
  # ./tex/latex/geometry:
  # geometry.sty
#+end_src
