In November 2022, I wrote an article [[https://www.baeldung.com/linux/change-incremental-searching-direction-shell][Change the Direction of Incremental
Searching in a Shell]] for [[https://www.baeldung.com/linux/alias-run-shadowed-command][Baeldung]].

While researching content for this article, I enjoyed various tangents which
included:
- learning about the architecture of the terminal (tty core, tty line
  discipline, tty drivers, ...)
- understanding the implications of the keyword in "emulator" terminal emulator;
  shells operate under the assumption that they were talking to a physical
  terminal!

Martin Balao has a very nice [[https://martin.uy/blog/how-terminal-emulators-work-on-linux/?fbclid=IwAR2Q_E_3j5EYGhL61GeZPQeJeCN-9roD-SiO_h0U4U2ILkBzzaR-ZsKu3Zg][article]] studying the plumbing of the terminal
emulators.
