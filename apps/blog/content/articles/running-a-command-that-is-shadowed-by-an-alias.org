In May 2022, I wrote an article [[https://www.baeldung.com/linux/alias-run-shadowed-command][Running A Command That Is Shadowed by an Alias]]
for [[https://www.baeldung.com/linux/alias-run-shadowed-command][Baeldung]].

Here, I discovered in-depth the *[[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Quoting.html][Quoting]]* feature of the bash shell, also known
as escaping. Did you know that we can simply use quotes to remove escape an
alias?

#+begin_src shell
alias echo='echo helloworld.'
echo # helloworld
"echo" hello, world. # hello, world.
#+end_src
