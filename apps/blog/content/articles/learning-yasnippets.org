* Creating snippets

The command ~yas-new-snippet~ will open a form for creating snippets.

The ~# name:~ and ~# key:~ fields describe the name of the snippet, and the
abbreviation of the snippets before expansion.

* Authoring snippets

** embedded lisp code in template

Wrap the lisp code with ~`~. This will be evaluated upon expansion.

* Finding snippets

I don't think there's a way to list *all* snippets, but I'm mostly often
interested in editing snippets I've written, which are saved in the first
directory of the ~yas-snippet-dirs~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (expand-file-name (car yas-snippet-dirs))
#+end_src

The directory is organized by major modes with the applicable snippets.
