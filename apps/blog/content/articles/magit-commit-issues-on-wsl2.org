* About

The *magit* package uses the /with-editor/ package to spin up an emacsclient in
order to run subprocesses. This is used when drafting commit messages.

With a vanilla installation of Ubuntu 22.04, I'm *not* able to spin up an
emacsclient:

#+begin_src shell
  emacsclient helloworld
  # emacsclient: can't connect to /run/user/1000//emacs/server: Permission denied
  # emacsclient: No socket or alternate editor.  Please use:
  # 
  #         --socket-name
  #         --server-file      (or environment variable EMACS_SERVER_FILE
#+end_src

I've fixed this by changing the ownership of that directory to myself: ~sudo
chown ${USER}:${USER}  $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR~ and it works!

And now I can commit. :)
