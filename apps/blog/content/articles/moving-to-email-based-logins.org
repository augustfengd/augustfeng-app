* About

I've accidentally created a few online accounts with GitHub as the IdP and then
later changed to email address.

Since I'm trying to transition to email login only, I'm documenting here the
experience I've had.

* Vercel

On Vercel, I initially created my account using GitHub as the IdP. This is (was)
confirmed when I visit my account's
https://github.com/settings/apps/authorizations and see it in the *Authorized
GitHub Apps*.

In Vercel's [[https://vercel.com/account/settings/authentication][authentication]] page, I also see the reciprocal connection towards
GitHub.

If I disconnect from Vercel side, I can reconnect seamlessly without any
authentication.

However, if I revoke the application's access from GitHub's side, then a
disconnect/reconnect will retrigger an authorization/permission prompt.
