* About

I never had to number a list of lines so many times until my most recent study
on TCP sequence numbers.

* How

Paste a bunch of lines, and use the ~string-rectangle~ command to insert "1." at
the beginning:

#+begin_quote
1. hello
1. world
1. .
#+end_quote

Finally, move the cursor to any of thes lines and press ~C-c~:

#+begin_quote
1. hello
2.  world
3. .
#+end_quote
