* About

There are some obstacles in a successful build of zsh on MacOS due to [[https://www.w3.org/Tools/YODL.html][yodl]] not
being readily distributed for MacOS.

This isn't too concerning, but it does make the build command exit with an
error, which can fail an automation.

In my situation, this fails the required build step for a [[https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/makefiles-support.html#rd-configs][Native Application]]
configuration in CLion; I can't build and run/debug the program in one command.

* Workaround

At first I looked into compiling the yodl program locally, but it relies on a
build program that isn't readily distributed either on MacOS.

Instead digging myself a rabbit hole grave, I just removed the ~install.man
install.runhelp~ requirements from the ~install~ target in the Makefile.

/Hint/: I edited the ~Makefile.in~ because the Makefile is generated.
