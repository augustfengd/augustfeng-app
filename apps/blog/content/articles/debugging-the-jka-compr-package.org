* About

The *jka-compr* package allows us to read compressed files as if they were
uncompressed. It uses an external tool in the backend, ~gunzip~ in the case of
MacOS as seen in the source code.

* Issue

There seems to be an issue with a locally compiled emacs (29.0) where Spacemacs
ignores the ~jka-compr.elc~ files, and tries to load the compressed
~jka-compr.el.gz~, which is a circular dependency / bootstrap issue.

This is hinted in a discussion from an unrelated(?)  [[https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=60346][bug report]].

* Fix

I didn't pinpoint if the preference of ~*.el.gz~ was due a behaviour in
Spacemacs, instead I just deleted all compressed files in the
~Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp~ directory:

#+begin_src sh
  find Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp -name '*.el.gz' -exec rm {} \;
#+end_src

* Fix (Updated)

I found out that these compressed lisp files are the original ~.el~. As a
result, I'd rather decompress them to recover the ~.el~ for debugging instead:

#+begin_src sh
  find Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp -name '*.el.gz' -exec gzip -d {} \;
#+end_src
