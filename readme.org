* About

Hello! This is a project for my cloud infrastructure, mostly driven
with [[https://cuelang.org/][CUE]].

* Overview

** Cloud

The [[file:cloud/][cloud]] directory contains self-bootstrapping and reusable infrastructure code.

A GitHub pipeline is generated which will provision a GKE cluster and
subsequently deploy cluster services. ArgoCD is deployed first and will pull in
the remaining cluster services such as the ingress controller.

See any of the recent pipelines [[https://github.com/augustfengd/augustfeng.app/actions/workflows/cloud.yaml][runs]] for a visual explanation.

** Apps

The [[file:apps/][apps]] directory contains code for my applications. The images for these
containers are built and published from the pipelines using dagger.io, see the
plan configuration [[file:containers/containers.cue][here]].
