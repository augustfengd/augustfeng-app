* About

When we install MacTeX, ~/Library/TeX/texbin~ gets added to the *$PATH*
environment variable.

This configuration isn't found in the typical ~~/.profile~, ~~/.zprofile~
~~/.zshrc~ or ~/etc/profile~.

Instead, that path is found in a file in ~/etc/paths.d~. When I chatGPT, it says
it's not part of any specs so it's a MacOS specific thing.
