#+title: forward word in zsh

* About


In Emacs, the *M-f* key sequence is bound to ~forward-word~ moves the cursor to
the _end_ of the current word.


In Zsh, the *M-f* key sequence is also bound to ~forward-word~, but it moves the
cursor to the _beginning_ of the next word.

I've been allowing this inconsistency for far too long when Zsh provides a
standard widget that implements the same behaviour as Emacs:
~emacs-forward-word~.

Let's just rebind it now:

#+begin_src zsh
  bindkey "^[f" emacs-forward-word
#+end_src
