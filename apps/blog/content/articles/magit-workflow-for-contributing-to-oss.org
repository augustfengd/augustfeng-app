* About

It's been only a little while since I made a pull request to an open-source
project and I forgot the conclusion I had about setting up my local git
repository.

* Conclusion

I structure my file system with git repositories from github so that it
replicates the ~<OWNER>/<REPO>~ in github.

Earlier, I nearly duplicated the repository to ~augustfengd/<REPO>~ because the
repository will technically exist as as fork and I will be pushing there. *No.*

Instead, I should configure the local upstream repository so that pushes default
there:

#+begin_src toml
[remote "augustfengd"]
	url = https://github.com/augustfengd/spacemacs
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/augustfengd/*
[remote]
	pushDefault = augustfengd
#+end_src

And I should pull with rebase.
