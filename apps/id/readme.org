* About

I wrote this lambda with the purpose of integrating it with API Gateway and protecting the route with IAM AUTH:

#+begin_src shell
  curl --aws-sigv4 "aws:amz:us-east-1:execute-api" --user "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}:${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}" --header "x-amz-security-token: $AWS_SESSION_TOKEN" "https://qq78eckyzg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
#+end_src
