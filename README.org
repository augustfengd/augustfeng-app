* About

Hello! This is a project for my personal infrastructure. I manage a set of
self-hosted applications here for my convenience and learning experience. ðŸ˜Š

* Directory structure

** ./terraform

Terraform configuration can be written in a [[https://www.terraform.io/language/syntax/json][JSON configuration syntax]], which
enables someone to use a DSL to generate the configuration files
programmatically.

For this project, I am using [[https://cuelang.org/][CUE]] to generate the configuration files, and its
scripting capabilities to manage a Terraform Cloud workspace.

** ./kubernetes

I had initially generated the Kubernetes manifest files using [[https://cuelang.org/][CUE]] until I wanted
to use upstream helm charts.

To overcome the shortcoming of not being able to override fields that have yet
been templated, the charts are templated and then overridden with mixins using
configuration language, [[https://jsonnet.org/][Jsonnet]].

I may go back to a [[https://cuelang.org/][CUE]] based solution eventually.

** ./containers

The modern-day pipelines are essentially the /cloud equivalent/ of local build
scripts. The [[https://dagger.io/][dagger.io]] project attempts to consolidate the gap by leveraging [[https://cuelang.org/][CUE]]
to bring a pipeline execution to a local workstation.

Generally speaking, I like to avoid building containers to save myself the
footprint and the need to maintain imperative build scripts.

However, the [[https://docs.dagger.io/1221/action/#definition][docker]] package from dagger.io is an enjoyable alternative to a
~Dockerfile~ + ~Makefile~. I might be a little bit more prolific than usual.

** ./github

The GitHub Workflows configuration files are generated using [[https://cuelang.org/][CUE]]. Programming
the pipeline configuration feels like a less fragile experience as we can
abstract certain areas of the configuration files with more meaningful
semantics.

At a larger scale, using a DSL for generating pipeline configuration can create
a ton of value that wouldn't be possible otherwise.

For example, imagine a centralized ~configuration.cue~ that defines *N*
infrastructures. We could generate a pipeline configuration for each
infrastructure while controlling the composition at a granular-level. This
approach allows us not to require external systems to implement dynamic
semantics in our configuration.

** ./web

Occasionally I will need want to write my own application or services! They will
enjoy their space here.

*** blog

Please visit https://blog.augustfeng.app/ for some content written by yours truly!

*** file transfer

I am hosting a deployment of [[https://github.com/dutchcoders/transfer.sh][transfer.sh]] at https://transfersh.augustfeng.app/.

Please note that the deployment is running on a single worker-node kubernetes
cluster, made with the cheapest ($) droplet that [[https://digitalocean.com/][DigitalOcean]] possible, so no
promises about data availability!

Saving cost is an important feature for me ðŸ˜‰.
